this is a ongoing project for some sort of multiplayer adventure game.

a word of warning, this repository is generally not stable, and may not run.  there is a stable version under the downloads section that showcases some of the client's features.



server:
    network support coming soon with twisted integration
    native support for tiled maps
    save game and persistence for all objects
    supports adventure and platform style games

client:
    supports keyboard and joystick movement
    scrolling map for large areas
    animated sprites

goals are:
    generic server and client
    resources from the server can be pushed to the client
    framework for multiplayer games


started during pyweek sept '11, has slowly morphed into something else.


people interested in the game are more than welcome to fork the game and try
to make something of it.  i develop the game and library, lib2d, in my spare
time and sometimes will make huge changes.  that being said, there isn't much
documentation except for the comments.  use at your own risk!



RUNNING:

run 'run.py' to run the client.
the server must also be running, but is not started automatically.


HAVE FUN!
